# FluidMechanics-ITA

This repo contains some personal material (notes and some programs) prepared during the teaching activity for the course of Fluid Mechanics, a 3rd-year BSc course in Politecnico di Milano.

So far, the notes are available in Italian only.

## Contents
### Notes
This repo contains three main documents: "Notes about Fluid Mechanics", "Review of Mathematical Analysis and Introduction to Tensor Algebra and Calculus", "Questions and Answers".

### Programs
This repo contains some programs and scripts about:
- Archimedes' principle and buoyant force: equilibrium and stability
- Flow around a 2D airfoil, with panel method: panel method; integration of integral boundary layer equations; force evaluation with control volume methods; uncertainty estimation of the computed loads.
- Integration of the Lorenz's dynamical equations and relation with the solution of Boussinesq equations for natural convection.

## Contributions
Contributions of different nature would be really appreciated, as
- Translation in English of the notes (or part of them)
- Correction of the existing material
- Additional material
