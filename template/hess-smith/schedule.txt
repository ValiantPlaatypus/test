Routines needed for Hess-Smith method of a NACA airfoil

1. build_geometry:
in : naca airfoil, dimensions (chord), position (ref.point,theta,...)
out: rr, ee, ee_te,
     elems.ver1, ver2, cen, len, tver, nver

2. compute velocity from unitary line source:
in : elem, control point
out: vel

3. compute velocity from unitary line vortex:
in : elem, control point
out: vel

2. and 3. need the computation of the expression of the induced velocity:
- give the formula and let the students prove it
